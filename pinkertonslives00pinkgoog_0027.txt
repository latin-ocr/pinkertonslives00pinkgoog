ST. CUMnssAN or Cuimene Ailbhe,¹ the author oi the first Lite
, of St Columba in the present volume, and seventh Abbot ol
Hy, was the son os Ernan‚ son ol Fiachna, os the race oi
Conall Gulban, and the district of Tyrconnel. contemporary

Abbot of Hy in 657. During his presidency Iona was for the
second time devastated by a violent pestilence. In 661 he
visited lreland, and died February 24, 669. Colgan has
