said to bea diminutive of Adam, and occurs also as Adam·
pnanus, Adomnanus, Thewnan, Aunan, Eunan, Onan, Ounan,
Fidamnan, Teunan, Eonan, and Arnold.¹ He was born in lre-
land, at Drumhome, in the South-west of Donegal, in or about
the year 624 By his father Ronan, who was sixth in descent
from Conall Gulban, the head of one of the two great taces
nithe Northren Hy Neill, he was of the same lineage as St
Columba His mother, Ronnat, was descended from Enna, a
son of Niall, whose race, the Cinel Enna, took possession of
the country between the Foyle and Swilly, called formerly
Tit-Enna, or land of Enna, and now the barony of Raphoe,
where stood the ancient church of Rath-both, said to have been
founded by St Columba, but for which, when it became the
seat of a bishop, Adamnan was adopted as the patron saint,
under the sostened form of his name St Eunan. Os Adam-
nan's early years nothing is known; not even alegend has
survived, except the following in the life of Finnachta the
Festive,a chief of the Southern Hy Neill, and subsequently,
King of lreland :-“ Not long aster this, Finnachta came, with
a numerous cavalcade, to the house of his sister, whithcr he
was invited to be her guest As they were riding along the
way, they met Adamnan, then a schoolboy, who was travelling
upon the same road, with a jar of milk upon his back And
as he fied frorn the way, before the cavalcade, he knocked his
foot against a stone, and stumbled, and the jar fell from his
back and was broken. Upon which Finnachta said, ‘Thou
shalt receive protection,0 student, from me,’ and he prayed
him not to be sorrowful. Then said Adamnan, ⁸0 good man,

lhave cause for grief, for there are three goodly students in
our house, and three more of us are attendants upon them.
And how we act is this: one attendant from among us goes
out in turn to collect sustenance sor the other five; and it was
my turn to·day, but what l had gathered for thern has bcen
spilled upon the ground; and, what grieves me more, the

ruma, Adamnam' Vela Columbae, pp. 256, and lxi. n. i.. the principal

authority lor all thar concems St. Columba, his biographers, and the Colunrlrinn
monlrs.
