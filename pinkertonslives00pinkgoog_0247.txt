De angelorum eontra demones forti belligeratione, Sancto
in eodem bello opportune subvenientium.

ALIA die, vir sanctus in lona conversans insula, remotiorem

¹ St. Columba's recorded encounters with demons are numerous. Dr. Reeves
cites the following legend ol King Branrlubh's death as containing the narrative of
his most brilliant achievernent in this way: “ Brandubh was killed on the morrow,
and demons carried oli his soul into the air. And illaedhog [Abbot oi F erus] heard
the wail ol his soul as it was undergoing pain, while he was with the reapers. And
he went into the air, and began battle with the demnas. And they passed over
Hy: and Columkille heard them while he was writingr and he stuck the style into
his cloak, and went to the battle, to the aid ol Maedhog, in deienee ol Brandubh’s
soul. And the battle passed over Rome, and the style sett out oi Columkille’s
cloat, and dropped in iront oi Gregory, who took it up in his hand. Columkille
lollowed the soul ol urandubh to heaven. When he reached it, the congregation
oi heaven were at Celebration, namely, Te deret nynmus, and Benedir anima meo,
and Laudato pueri Donrinunr,· and this is the beginning ol the Celebration ol'
heaven. Columkille did the same as the people ol heaven. And they brought
Brandubh's soul back to his body again. Columkille tarried with Gregory ; and
brought away Gregory's brooch with him, and it is the hereditary brooch ol' the
coarb os Columkille to this day. And he lelt his style with Gregory.”—1.ib.
