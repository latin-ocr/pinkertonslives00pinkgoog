lt was first printed by Pinkerton in the original edition oi this
work. The text ol the Dublin MS. was printed by Dr. Forbes
in 1874, who also collated with it the MS. used by Pinkerton.
Tm superiority ol the Dublin text is incontestible, and it has
been thought better to substitute it in the present edition ior
that oi the British Museum MS. The MS. has been again
read, and a number oi corrections made on the text as printed

by Dr. Forbes
Capgrave printed an abridgement oi Jocelin’s Life, which

· was reproduced by the Bollandists at January 13.

The other Liie, as already remarked‚ was written by a cleric
os St Kentigem at the suggestion ol Herbert Bishop ofGlasgow,
who died in 1164 Whether it was ever finished is unknown ;

British Museum, corr MSS, Titus A. xix.‚t'. 76-8o It was
first printed by Mr. Cosmo lnnes in the Registrum Episcopatus
Glasgwemis, vol. i.‚ p. lxxviii.-lxxxvi.; and afterwards by
Bishop Forbes in his Lines os S. Nim'an and S. Kentigem
The nine lections in the Office oi St Thenew‚ or St. Enoch,
the mother os Kentigem, in the Aberdeen Breviary, are taken
t‘rom it ; and it is evidently the Life referred to by Fordun‚ who
says it was in the “libro de Duniermlyn.’'

The favourite name oi St. Kentigem is St Mungo. ln
Wales there are no dedications to him; but in Cumberland
there are eight, at Aspatria, Bromiield, Caldbeck, Crosthwaite

Grinsdale,1sthington, Sowerby,Mungrisedale; and in Scotland
fourteen, viz„ two in Dumiriesshire, at St Mungo or Abermilk
and Kirkmahoe in N ithsdale; two in Lanarkshire, at Lanark
and Borthwick or Lochwerweth; two in Mid·Lothian‚ at

Penieuik, where is his well, and Currie; one in Berwickshire,
at Polwarth3 one at Peebles; one at Auchterarder; one at
Inverness; one at Alloa; two in Aberdeenshire, at Kynor and
