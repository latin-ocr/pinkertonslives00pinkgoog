author of numerous works. Besides the Life of St Ninian,
which singularly enough is mentioned neither by Capgrave nor
Cave, the following works are attributed to him: A History
of the Life and Miracles of Edward the Confessor3 A Des·
cription of the Battle of the Standard; An Eulogium of St
David of Scotland; A Genealogy of the Kings of Eng-
land; A Life of King Edward, written in verse and ad·
dressed to Lawrence, Abbot of Westminster; A Rule for
Nuns ; A Speculum Charitatis; An Account of the
Foundation of the Monasteries of St Mary at Yorlc and of
Fountains; A Tractate on the Sunday within the Octave of
the Epiphany; A Dialogue on the Nature of the Soul; and
various letters, homilies‚ and sermons.¹ Henriquez adds to
this list, but remarks, ⁴‘ Nota quod hujus scripta quaedam cum
scriptis Edilredi Abbatis Wardensis confunduntur.”¹

According to Reginald of Durham, Ailred visited Galloway
in the year 1164, and was present in Kirkcudbrightshire on the
Feast of Sc Cuthbert in that year. He mentions also that, on
the occasion referred to, a penitent was miraculously freed
from an iron belt which he wore, and that a bull which had
been offered in oblation to St. Cuthbert, was baited in the
churchyard by the clerics, “qui Pictorum lingua Scollofthes
connominantur ;” and further, that the said bull gored one of
the bystanders to death for having, when rebuked, mocked the
Saint to whom it had been offered. Whether Ailred was in
Galloway at any other period is not known ; but that he was
there, at least once, is vouehed for also by Capgrave, who
describes his visit, and gives a very graphic account of the low
moral condition of the people³

lt was probably while visiting the south-west of Scotland
that Ailred was induced to undertake the writing of St
Ninian’s Life. From the Prologue, it appears to have been
written at the desire of a Bishop of Candida Casa This
Bishop was, in all probability, Christianus, who was consecrated
