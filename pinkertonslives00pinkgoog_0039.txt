terprise, and the point frorn whence his influence penetrated to
almost every corner os Scotland and Pictland ln 573 he lost
his friend and admirer, St Brendan os Birr. The following
year he formally inaugurated his cousin, Aidan, King ol British
Dalriada, the sovereignty oi which had become vacant through
the death os Conall‚ the prince by whom he had probably been
invited to take up his residence in Scotland. ln 575 he accom-
panied Aidan to the Synod oi Drumceatt, when the claims ol
the Irish King to the homage of British Dalriada were aban-
doned, and the independence oi that province declared. Two
years later, in 577, died St Brendan os Clonfert, and in 579 St.
Finnian oi Moville. Besides the battle oi Cooldrevny‚ St
Columba is said to have been directly or indirectly concerned
in two others, the battle oi Coleraine and the battle ol Cuilsedha,
near Clonard. The first of them is said to have originated in a
quarrel which arose between St Columba and St Comgall
respecting a church oi the latter's in the neighbourhood os
Coleraine. ln the second, as in that os Cooldrevny, the Northern
and Southern branches oi the Hy Neill were opposed to each
other, but to what extent St Columba participated in either ol
the battles is not known. That he was deeply interested in
them is unquestionable. As already noticed‚ it was customary
as late as in Adamnan's time for women to enter battle, and
the monastic communities os lreland were not sormally ex-
empted from military service until the year 804 Subsequently
to June 585, St. Columba again visited lreland, when he pro-
ceeded westwardlrom Durrow to Clonmacnois, and was there
received with tokens oi the utmost affection and respect
Eight years later he appears to have been visited with sickness
and to have been brought near to death; but he survived till
just after midnight, between Saturday the 8th and Sunday the

9th June, 597, when he died, kneeling before the altar, without
struggle or pain.

Adamnan describes St Columba as angelic in appearance,
graceiul in speech, with a holy joy ever beaming in his sace,
and implies that he was altogether dove-like in character ; but

Montalembert is perhaps nearer the truth when he says, that
in temper he was no “ Columba,” gentleness being the one vir-
