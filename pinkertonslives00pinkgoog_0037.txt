xxviii. INTRODUCTION.

ously iurnished Colgan with his text ln 1725 Canisius's text
was once more reprinted by Basnage in his Thesaurus Monu-
mentorum Ecclesiasticorum et Histon'corum. The Life next
appeared in the original edition os the present work. Pinkerton
proiessed to give the textos the MS. in the British Museum,
Cod. B. The dehet in the beginning ol that MS. he made up
irom Canisius, from whom also he borrowed a number of read·
ings. The better and fuller texts ol Colgan and the Bollandists
he neglected.' The last and by far the best edition oi the Life is
the one already referred to as prepared by Bishop Reeves sor
the lrish Archaeological and Celtic Society in 1857. The work
is in every respect a magnificent piece ol editing, and an
almost inexhaustible mine os information on all things pertain-

ln the present edition it has been borne in mind that the text
prosessed to be produced by Pinkerton was that of B: but in
numerous instances when a better reading has presented itsell,
it has been adopted. The defect in the MS. has been sup
plied lrom Colgan, the Bollandists, and Dr. Reeves. To Dr.
Reeves the editor has been indebted sor permission to make use
os his readings ol B and Codex Cott. To the same learned
author he is also indebted sor the generous permission to make
use oi the information contained in the very ample and erudite
notes, which are not the least valuable feature in his Adamnani
Vita Columba, and on which every editor ol Adamnan must
hencelorth more or less draw. For several pieces ol information
contained in the notes to the present volume the editor has

been indebted to Dr. W. F. Skene's edition os Adamnan.
