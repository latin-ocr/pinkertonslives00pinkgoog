whom he cites by name, and whose entire work he has trans·

mernoir, on the authority of which he relates an incident not

as Dr. Reeves has also pointed out, certain poems on the
praises os St Columba, in Irish, among which was probably
the celebrated Ambra or panegyric, eomposed by a contem·
porary os the Saint Certain poems ascribed to Baithene Mor,

ol' the text printed by Dr. Reeves in his remarkably learned
