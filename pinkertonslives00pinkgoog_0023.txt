The Pope would be either Damasus, (hl). 366·384), or siricius,
(an. 38 5-399). After studying several years in Rome, Ninian
was raised to the Episcopate by the Pope himself, in, it is said,
394, and sent to preach the Gospel in the parts of Westem
Britain where it had not been preached, or where it had been
preached in a corrupt sorm. On his way home Ninian visited
St. Martin os Toum, with whom he held much spiritual inter·
course, and from whom he received masons, or, according to the
Scottish Legend, “masonis twa,” to build churches according
to the Roman method. On his arrival in Galloway he built
his church at Witerna, now Whithern or Whithorn, either on
the site occupied by the later Abbey oron the island near the
shore, called the Isle of Whithern. Tradition is in favour os
the latter, but the exact spot is uncertain. As the building was
being completed, news reached Ninian of the death os St

tended to these counties is open to doubt By “australes
Picti,’' Bede may have meant simply the Picts of Galloway;
while the sact that the Saint has many dedicatione in the above
mentioned counties, can, perhaps, be taken as indicating little
more than the measure os veneratior] in which he was held

To what extent St Ninian was connected with lreland is
not known. That he had some connection with it seems to be
certain. The story os the lrish Life, however, that towards
the close os his life he was compelled to flee from Galloway
and sought refuge in lreland and was buried there, is scarcely
probable Still the lact that he was known in lreland and was
held in reverence there, cannot be doubted, as his name with
