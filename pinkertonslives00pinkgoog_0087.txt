nearly thesaure), meaning, namely Scotti. Neither the Picts nor tbe Sootti probably
owued the names, the former of which is to be traced to Roman authors, while the
latter was probably given the invaders by the Brythons, whose country they crossed
the sea to ravage The Scots, however, did recognize a national name, which
described them as painted or tattooed men. Rather we should say it did more ς it
connoted the embellishment ol the person, which the tattooing was supposed to
effect. This word was Cruithnig. which is iound applied equally to the painted
people ol both islanda. . . . The eponymus ol all the Picts was Cruithne, or
Cruithnechan, and we have akindred Brythonic form in Prydyn, the nameby which
Scotlnnd once used to be known to the Kymry. . . . These words Cruithnig
aud Prydyn ore derived lrom crath and pryd respectively, which mean torm, and an
Irish shanachie has rightly explained Cruithnig as meaning apeople who painted
the forms (crotha) oi beasts, birds, fishes on their laces, and not on their iaces only,
but on the whole ol the body.” Rhys, Celtic Britain, pp. 2357.

4 The Northern Picis, Bede’s Transmontnne Picts, inhabited the whole ol the
country north ot the chniu ol mountains extending across the island from Ben
Nevis in Lochaber to its termination on the east coast between Aberdeen and
Stonehaven, and appear to have been purely Gaelic in race and language. The
Southern Picts, the australes Picti ol Bede and Ailred, had their scats in the
Pertbshire and Forlarshire Highlands, with Drumalban, separating them from the
Scots ol Dalriarla, lor their western boundary‚ and the F orth lor their boundary on
the south. See Sirene, Celtic Scot, i. 23o231. That St. Ninian ever pushedso
lar north asto the t'oot oi the Grampians may be doubted. 1t is much more likely
that he confined his labours to the Picta of Galloway. Bede's testimony, however,
ii not conclusive, isat least explicit. Cl. his words, Hira, iii, 4.
