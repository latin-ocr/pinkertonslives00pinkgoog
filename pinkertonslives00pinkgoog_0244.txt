accepisset, ab eo jussus, legere coepit Qui cum secundum
quod ei in libro erat commendatum Aidanum in regem ordinare
recusaret, quia magis logenanum⁴ fratrem ejus diligeret, subito
angelus, extendens manum, Sanctum percussit flagello, cujus
livorosum in ejus latere vestigium omnibus suae diebus pcr-
mansit vitae. Hocque intulit verbum: Pro certo scias,
inquiens, quia ad tea Dco missus sum curn vitreo libro, ut
juxta verba quae in eo legisti, Aidanum in regnum ordines.
Quod si obsecundare huic nolueris jussioni, percutiam te iterato.
Hic itaque angelus Domini, cum per tres continuas noctes,
eundem in manu vitreum habens codicem, apparuisset,
eademque Domini jussa de regis ejusdcm ordinatione commen·

fiat oi AEdan's inauguration. and the saint’s hesitation vas, not an unwillingnesa to
employ any formulas supposed to have been contained therein, but a reluctanoe to
receive the object ol beaven’s choice instead oi his own.’' The Marquess os Date,
however, suggests “that the true explanation may lie between the two.'’ “The
boolr,'’ he continues, “ was as immaterial as the angel who bore it, and the notiora
oi the substantial volume oi some well-known old copy oi a prayer·book with glast
lrnobs on the binding is altogether inadmissible arnid the airy fabric oi a vision.
Moreover, the fault oi Columba was not a ritualistic scruple about using sonae parti· ’
cular iorm oi service, buta resistance to the ordination oi Aidan in particular, whose
name the boolr contained sornewhere nenr the beginning. And this circumstance
itsell shows that a common earthly copy ol the Ritual munet be meant, since
in all Ritual books ol this kind a blanlr (or rather, the letter N as initial oi Nomen)
occupies the place ol the name ol the King-elecr, where tbe officiant is to insert it.
lt was in order that he might read the name there that tbe bools nasgiven to
Columba, ubo cannot be supposed to bave been ignorant oi the iornrs oi a well·
known Church service3 although it is also possible that it may be represented as
now lor the first time officially placed in his hands on this, the first occasion since
his removal to Scotland, that a vacancy had occurred upon the Dalriadic 'l'hrone''
. . . “lt sceau impossible to understand the boolr mentioned asother thane
visionary presentment os a copy oi the Ordination Ritual, in whose letters oi light
tbe name oi Aidan was inserted in the prayers. lt was given to Columba to read,
not only as charging him with the duty oi performing the religious inauguration oi
the Kings ol Dalriada . . . but also that be might see by reading in it whose
name be should first have to insert in it. ‘’ Oi the three explanations, the last is
the most satislactory3 but see the Scottislr Reur'errr, Janunry, 1888, Atticis-“The
Earliest Scottish Coronations,” ubere the subject is very lully discussed by the
last mentioned writer.
