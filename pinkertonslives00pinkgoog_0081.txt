monlrs to build their Priory on the site of the primitive church ς and further. their
chief aim would be to build a House to thememory ol the Saint in the place most
suitable lor the work they had in hand. (3) The silence of tradition is not proof
that a translation did not take place. On the other hand tradition isunmistaltenbly
in favour of the lsle. Barbour mentions both the church built by St. Ninian‚ and
the procession held in his honour, but unfortunately nothing definite respecting

the site of the former. His words respecting the latter are:

‘¹ And for he sa welle [her] wrocht
Of hyme God foraetful is nocht,

The whole question is one of great difficulty and is probably insoluble

³⁴¹ When the Saxona were converted ιο Christianity they were not masons 3 they
dwelt in wooden homes, and there cau be no doubt that their churches were also
usually of wood. This is confirmed by numerous passages in contemporary
historiens, and the frequent mention of the destruction of churches by fire.''
Parlrer's Introd. to tlte Study os Gothic A 111ιέ1, p. 9. According ιο Bede‚ Eccl.
Hira, v. 17, when Bishop Aidan was siclr “they set up a tent lor him close to the
wall 11 the west-end of the church. by which means it happened that he gave up
the ghost leaning againsta post that was on the outside to strengthen the wall.''
Some time afterwards Penda King of the Mercians, burnt down the adjoining
village and the church. ‘⁸ but it fell out in a wonderful manner ” says Bede, “that
the post which Aidan had leant upon when he died. could not be consumed
hy the fire which consumcd all about it.” ’1111 same post was used in rebuild·
ing the church. and when the structure was again burned down, the post was
again miraculously preserved. Even as late as 1032. when King Canute gave
his cbuter ιο Glastonbury Abbey‚ the church there was built of wood. 111
walls. however, were covered on the outside with lead, and on the inside with
platea of silver and gold. Gloss. os Architect„ p. 10.and chron. Petriburg„ p. 3„
As to the manner in which the Scotch and lrish churches were built, we have the
following note in Beda, Eccl. Hirr.. iii. 25, where speaking of the church which St.
Finan built iu the island of Lindisfame‚ he says: ⁴⁸ Nevertheless, aster the manner
ostie Scots hc made it not of stone, but of hewn oak, and covered it with reeds.”
