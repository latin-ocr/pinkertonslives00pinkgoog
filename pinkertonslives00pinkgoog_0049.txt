back to the Fiftb Century.³ At the close of tbe ninth lection,
however, itis said there was another St Servanus “natione
israeliticus '’ who lived on the island of Petmoolr in the time of
Adamnan But this, as Dr. Sirene observes, “does not help
matters much, as it involves the improbability of both having
founded Culenros, and both dying on the same day, the first oi
July.''⁴ The Chronology oi the Saint, in fact, though oi con·
siderable iniportance in connection with the Culdees‚ is involved
in obscurity, but the weight of evidence is against the tradition
recorded by Jocelin in the Life of St Kentigeru and in favour
of the later date given by Dr. Skene⁵

According to Bishop Forbes the remains oi St Seri were et
Culross in 1530 He is the patron of Culross, Creich and
Dysart One of his churches is at Monivaird in Perthshire He
is also found at Dunning. Α mortgage on the lands oi Hilton
in the barony of Dunnottar‚ is made redeemable “aiore S. Serwe
altar in the paroche kyrk of Monkege,'’ now Keithhall, in
Aberdeenshire, the present parish church of which is situeted
on a portion of “ Sant Sare’s bank ’' where the fair of St. Sare
issaid to heve been held before its removal to Culsalmond‚
where it is now held to the N ouh-west of the parish cburch on
the first of July.⁶
