14 VITA

nisi in sede Petri? Illuc certe, illuc mihi eundem est; ut
exiens de terra mea, et de cognatione mea, et de domo patris
mei ; merear in terra visionis videre voluntatem Domini, et
protegi a templo ejus.¹⁰ Arridet saeculi malefida prosperitas,
alludit mundi vanitas, blanditur cognationis affectio, deterret
labor et carnis afflictio. Set qui diligit patrem aut matrem
plusquam me, ait Dominus, non est me dignus. Et quinon
bajulat crucem suam, et sequitur me, non est me dignus¹¹ Di-
·dici etiam quod contempnentes aulam regiam pervenerint ad
regna caelestia Itaque Sancti Spiritus instinctu animatus;
spretis divitiis, omnibusque calcatis affectionibus peregrina·
tionem nobilis adolescens arripuit Transiensque Britannicum
mare, et per Gallicanas Alpes ¹² ingressus ltaliam, prospero
itinere ad Urbem usque pervenit¹³

¹² The date at which this event took place is unknown. AD· 370, when
Damasus was Pope, has been mentioned, but it is mere conjecture. According ιο
Varro there were five roads over the Alps into Italy ; by the Corniche, Mont Cenis,
Mont Genevre, the Great St. Bernard, and the Little St. Bernard; but which of
them st. Ninian followed is not known. Nor is it known at what season of the
year he made his joumey. Ammianus Marcellinus, who lived about the same time,
gives the following graphio description of the perils attending the passage of the
Alps: ‘⁶ In these Cottian Alps which begin at the town of Susa, a vast ridge rises
up, which is scarcely passable by any one without danger. On the Italian side
it descends with a steepness almost precipitous, and is terribie to behold on
account of the vast rocks which overhang the way on either side. Especially great
is the danger in the time of spring, when the ice is melting and the snows are being
dissolved beneath the warm breath of the winds. Those who attempt to descend
then, be it everso cautiously, men, beasts, and wagons are apt ιο fall into the
chasms and clefts which are hidden hythe frost. The only remedy found for
avoiding destruction is to bind several wagons together with strong ropes,
and then to have men and oxen hauging on behind, keeping them back with
great effort, and so allowing them to gradually slide down backwards with
acertain degree of safety. These things, as we have said, happen in the spring
of the year. But in winter the ground being covered over with a thin crust
of ice, and therefore slippery, the traveller is often plunged headlong; and ¹the
valleys which here and there open into wide plains covered with treacherous
ice, often devour those who endeavour ιο crosa them. On account of this those
who are acquainted with the country fix projeeting poles along the safer places,
in order that a series os them may lead the traveller to his destination un·
hurt3 but if the poles get covered with snow and hidden, orare thrown down
