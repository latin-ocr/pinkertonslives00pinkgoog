Douglas, under the name, first, of Crimthann, and then of Colum,
to which was afterwards added the suffix cille, signifying “of
the church,” because, it is said, of his diligent attendance at the
church of bis youtbful sojoum‚ or, as it is also said, because of
the many communities he formed. The chief part of his boy-
hood is said to have been spent at DoireEithne, a village not
far from Gartan. His chief instructors were St Finnian
of Moville, by whom be was ordained deacon; Gemman, an
aged bard in Leinster, St Finnian of Clonard, and Mobhi
Clarainech of Glasnevin, near Dublin. While at Clonard with
St Finnian he was ordained to the priesthood by Etchen, the

the Synod of Teltown in Meatb, held soon after the battle of
Cooldrevny in 561, which is said to have been brought about
chiefly by his instigation. The weight of opinion, however, is
on the side of Adamnan and Bede. ln support of it there is the
fact, that St Columba returned more than once to lreland and
took an active part in its civil and religious affairs At bis arrival
iu Scotland the Scots were already Christians in name ; the Picts
