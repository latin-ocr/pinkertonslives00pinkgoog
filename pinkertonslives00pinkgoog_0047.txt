xxxviii. INTRODUCTION.

Vl.

The Lile of st Serranus, Seri, Sair, or Serb, exists in
but one MS. This is the MS. in the Marsh Library, Dub
lin, already referred to as containing a version ol Jooelin's
Life ol St Kentigern lt isa small quarto volume on
parchment, with a plain call binding ol the time of James
L or Charles 1., and measuring seven and seven-eighths by
six and a quarter inches lt consists os sixty-two leaves,
written on both sides, on the first twelve os which is the
Life os St Serranus, and on the remaining hundred and twelve
that of St Kentigern. Within the cover is the following
inscription-,³⁴ Josias Hollington me jure tenet 21, 7¹¹⁶* 1650 ex
libris M Summers '' (or Sumners). There is also the name
‘⁴ We Armar'’ on the lly leaf. The MS. was presented to the
Library by Dr. C. Cobbe, Archbishop ol Dublin, in the year
1765 Itis the work os two copyists, and belongs apparently
to the Thirteenth Century. The general condition of the MS.
is sair, but unfortunately the binder has cut some os the edges
too close, and thus injured the marginal notes At the be-
ginning ol the Life ol Servanus there was originally a heading,
but so much has been cut away and so much of the colour is
laded‚ that the only words decipherable are ‘¹ incipit vita Sancti
Servani . . . q . . . Sanctum Kentigernum . . .’'
In the Life ol Servanus the chapters are divided as in the Life
of Kentigem, but without the headings. Each chapter begins
with an illuminated capital in red and green. lts Life of
Servanus is mentioned by Ussher,but was apparently unknown
to Pinkerton. Wyntown was acquainted with it lt was first
printed by Dr. W. F. Sirene in his Chroniclcs os tlte Picts and
Sans, pp. ‹tra-420. For the present work the MS. has again
been read.

The oldest authority lor the Life os Servanus is the tract
On the Mothers of tlte Saints of Irelarrd, attributed to Aengus
. the Culdee, in the Ninth Century, where he is said to be the
son ol Alma, daughter ol the King ol Cruithne and Proc King
