the editorial care of the Rev. W. Blew‚ MA The presace,
lrom which the above notes are taken, was supplied to the
reprint by Dr. Laing in 1855, who added the extra sheet from
the Glammis copy containing the Office os Our Lady ol Pity
andan abridgement oi Fordun's version ol the advent ol the
relics of St Andrew.

The traditions respecting St Andrew are numerous Most
oi them will be found in Tischendorl's Acta Apostolomm Apo
crypha,³ Abdias' Histortie Apostolicoe,⁴ and the Legenda Aurea⁵
The most important source for his martyrdom is the Epistle ol
the Presbyters and Deacons os Achaia,⁶ which has furnished
the Readings lor the Office ior the Saint in the Aberdeen
Breviary.

The Legend ol the bringing oi the relics to Scotland,
which is given in the second volume os the present work,
is taken from the Office oi St Regulus in the Aberdeen
Breviary. Two other versions ol the same Legend have been
printed by Pinkerton and Dr. Skene; the first in the appendix
to his Introduction os the History os Scotland, and the second in
his Chroniclcs of tlte Picts and Scots. The Legend is also given
by Fordun in his Chronicle ol the Scottish Nation, cc. xlvi.-
xlviii, where, as in the version os the Legend in the extra sheet
ol the Glammis copy of the Aherdeen Breviary, the names oi

’ ” the companions ol St Regulus are menlimed‘ As given by

Fordun they were: St. Damianus, the priest; the deacons
Gelasius and Thubaculus; Merinacus, the brother oi St
Damianus; Nerius and Elusenius, from Crete; Mirenus,
