INTRODUCTION. xiii.

While narrating several ol the incidents recorded by Ailred, it
records others, some ol which are said to have happened in the
author’s own day.

With the exception os the few facts cited from the Vener-
able Bede, Ailred’s narrative is ior the most part, as has already
been remarked, unhistorical, and it is now impossible to con·
struet more than the merest outline os the Saint’s life The
date os his birth is unknown, but as he died in or about the
year 432, it may be probably fixed about the year 366 or soon
aiter the middle ol the Fourth Century. Is we may believe
Ailred, he was bom somewhere near the shores oi the Solway
Firth, and was of royal descent According to the old lrish
Lile his mother was a Spanish princess. Both his parents are
said to have been Christians, and, according to the Scottish
Legend, he received the name oi N inian in baptism. -The lrish
life represents his father as first consenting to his following the
religious lise, and as then wishing to bring him back into the
world. Oi his teachers nothing is said; but being apt to learn,

he soon, we are told, surpassed them in learning. Then, as the
Scottish Legend putuit,

“He thocht be wald pes sortbyrmare
And be parfite into sic later
For soorne it ware gret to re
The thechure suld unkennaud be
Thareior his kyoe and bis cunctre
He levit, and pessit oure the se,
And dressit hyme Rome to selle
Gyi he mycht thare his seience elce.
And [als] ior to sek sanctis sere,
Thin plentusly in that place were,
For til elce his denocioae,
And get tbe Papis benysoue.”

Accordingly he set out on his pilgrimage,

“And, helpand God. sene come be
But lettinge sone oure the se,
And oome to Rome in lytil space.

Hele and sownd, be Godis grace,
