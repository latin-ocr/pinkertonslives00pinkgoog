The date of St Ninian’s death is almost, if not indeed
altogether, as uncertain as any other event in his life, with the
single exception mentioned above September 16, 432, has
been usually given, sometimes as on the authority of Bede‚ and
sometimes as on that of Ailred ς but the date is to be found in
neither writer. The author of the Scottish Legends of the
Saints gives September 16, 332, which is probablya mistake
for September 16, 432 ; and if so, we have in this tradition of
the Fourteenth Century, a confirmation of the generally
accepted date Other dates given are 437 and 512.

Os the esteem in which St. Ninian was held the stories
related of him by St Ailred, which probably formed the main
part os the “liber de Vita et Miraculis ejus barbario scriptus ''
he used, and which, in all likelihood, simply repeated the local
traditione os Galloway, are a sufficient witness. Further
evidence to the same effect is in the number of dedications
to the Saint These, in Scotland, as enumerated by Dr. Forbes, ⁷

are no fewer than sixty·six, and are found in Wigtonshire‚
Lanarksbire and Mid Lothian, in Argyllshire and Perthshire,
and along the East Coast as far North as the Shetland Isles.
But perhaps the most interesting evidence is that given hythe
author of the Cambridge MS, in the following lines:

“And for he sa welle [her] wrocht,
Of hyme God sorrersul is nocht,
