xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

the acts of St Waldeve are narrated, are given by Bower in the
Scotichronicon.· An abridgement 01 his Life of St. Helen is
cited by Tanner as being found in a MS. in the Bodleian
Library. Colgan has printed his Life of St Patrick as his
Sexta Vita in his Trias Thaumaturga.³ lt is also in Messing·
ham’s floriugr·um.⁴

Jocelin wrote his Life 01 St Kentigern, 33 he intimates ’
111 the Prologue, at the request 01 Jocelin, the then Bishop
01 Glasgow. At the time there was another Life 01 the Saint
in existence, and in common use in the Cathedral of Glasgow.
In all probability, it was the Life 01 which the only remaining
fragment is here printed immediately after Jocelin's lt bears
to have been written by acertain cleric of St Kentigem, at the
instance 01 Herbert‚ Bishop of Glasgow. This Life, assuming
11 10 be the one he refers to, Jocelin condemns, both 011 account
of its obscure and vitiated style, and because at the beginning
01 the narrative it contains things contrary to sound doctrine
and the Catholic saith ln his search 101 1031311313 he dis·
covered, he tells us, another Life-“a little volume written iu
the Scotic dialect, filled 110111 beginning to end with solecisms,
but containing at greater length the life aud 3313 01 the holy
Bishop.'' This he appears to have used as 1113 principal source
Any description 01 the Translation 01 the Saint 0101 the
miracles performed after his death, he informs us, he was unable
to find. Whether he added anything from the traditione he
found floating about as he ‘⁴ wandered through the streets and
lanes 01 the city seelring for the recorded Life 01 St Kentigem,”
he does not say. The inference from his Prologue is that he
used such 111313113130111)1 as he found written down.

The Life exists in two MSS, one 01 which is in the British
Museurn, Bibl. Cott Vitellius, c viii, 11. 148195 ; and the other
in Archbishop Marsh’s Library, Dublin, where it is marked V.
