INTRODUCTION. xi.

to the See at Bermondsey, by the Archbishop 01 Rouen acting
sor him 01 York, on the 19th 01 December, 1154 In 1177,
Christianus was suspended from the Episcopal Office for re-
fusing to attend the Council summoned to meet at Edinburgh,
by the Legate Vivian. He died at Holm Cultram, October
7, 1186, having survived Ailred by twenty years.⁴

According to a rubric at the beginning 01 the Life in the

MS. at the British Museum, the Lile was translated by Ailred
out os the Anglic into the Latin tongue The statement is
extremely doubtful Both in the Prologue and the Life, Ailred
speaks 01 his original authority being written in a ‘⁸ simplet,
rustic style '’ and a ‘⁴ barbarous language,'’ and the implication
01 the Prologue would seem to be, that these terms are used to
designate the vernacular 01 the country round about Candida
Casa; and il this be the case, the narrative used by Ailred
would be written notin some ‘Anglic’ dialect but in the Cel-
tic dialect, which continued 10 be spoken around Candida Casa
down to a period considerably later than that at which Ailred
wrote It has been said by Dr. Forbes that “it is not to be
supposed thata British or Cambrian book should have out·
lived all the troubles in Galloway, and first the establishment,
and then the destruction 01 the Saxon Hierarchy at Candida
Casa’' But it is not at all incredible that such may have been
the case Other books have outlived quite as many troubles ;
and why not a Celtic Lise 01 St Ninian?

What the older Life contained, it is impossible now to
ascertain with any degree 01 precision. Unless it was the
source whence the Venerable Bede obtained his information
respecting St Ninian, which it does not seem 10 have been, it
does not appear to have contained much, 11 indeed anything, of
historical importance. The few historica} facts in Ailred’s Lile
are admittedly taken from Bede; but all the rest is mainly
legend. His narrative cannot even be taken as giving a
picture 01 Galloway in the time 01 Ν10130. Almost the best
that can be said 01 11 is, that, with the few exceptions referred
to, it contains a number os indicatione 01 what it was in

sciron. Malim, eit. liaddeu and stubbs, Ceuneils and Eccita. Dm, il. ⁴⁴·
