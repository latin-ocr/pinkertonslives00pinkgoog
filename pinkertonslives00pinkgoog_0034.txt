Alcuin speak os him in the highest terms. Later writers, more

Masters say ‘⁴ he was a good man, according to the testimony

Thursday; he made a slave ol himself to these virtues; and,

opportunities ol conversing with those who had seen St
Columba, and he was now writing almost on the very spot
where his great predecessor had indited his last words, and
surrounded by objects every one ol which was fresh with the
impress of some interesting association.’'⁷ For documentary
materials, he had the Life by Cummian or Cuimene Ailbhe,
