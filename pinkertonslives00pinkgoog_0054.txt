Walalrldus Strabo or Strabus, the author ol' the Life os St
Blaithmaic, was a not unimportant writer of the Ninth
Century, though comparatively little is known about him. He
appears to bave been born towards the end ol the reign ol
Charles the Great, in Swabia or in some part ol the country
about the Upper Rhine. since he speaks ol the place ol his
birth as the ‘¹ terram quam nos Alamanni vel Suevl incolimus,’'
and as the “terra Alamannica” With this agrees the testimony
ol Sigbert ol Semblours and John Trithemius. According to
others, however, he was an AngloSaxon. By some he is said
to have studied first at St. Gall under Grimswald, and by others
at Reichenau under Tato. lt is generally agreed, however, that
he subsequently resided at St Fulda, and was the pupil ol
Rabanus Maurus. A similar uncertainty exists as to the
chronology and movements oi his later years, After holding
the office ol Dean in the monastery os St Gall, in 842 he was
chosen Abbot ol Richenau‚ Augia Dives, a not less celebrated
House of the Cistercian Order on an island in the lower part ol
Lake Constance Accordingto Trithemius he was ior some
time'president ol the school at Hirschfeld. Strabo was a sorne-
what voluminous writer both in prose and verse. His poetical
writings reler chiefly to the festivals os the Christian Church
and narrate lor the most part the incidente in the lives ol the
Apostles and Martyrs. The longest ol his poems describes a
vision which appeared to Weltinus, a monk ol Reichenau;
another is the Lite ol St leger. His prose writings are theo-
logical and historical. He died on the 17th ol July 849, while
on a journey to the Court ol Charles the Bald.¹

Ol St Blaithmaic nothing is known beyond what is contained

in Strabo's verses Hugo Menard, in his Benedictine Martyr-
ology, gives the following account ol him : S. Blathmacus Hiber·
