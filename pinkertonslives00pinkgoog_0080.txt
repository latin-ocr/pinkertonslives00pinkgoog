=1rs exact site is disputed. Two placas are claimed lor it ς one where the ruins
oi the Priory in tlte town oi Wbithom stantia the other about two miles south·
ward at tbe post called the lsle ui Whithom‚ where are tlte ruins oi a small chapel.
Ailred‘s words aliord no clue as to which ol these was the site. Tradition is in
favour oi the latter. ln his Larga Descriptiones Gattmoay. p. 49, Andrew Sym-
son, the minister ol Kirkinner, speaking ol the lsle, says: ‘⁴ h'eer ιο this place, at
the sea side, there is the ruines oi an old chapel, called the Chapel ol the lsle,
which. as it is tepor ted, was the lirst that was built lor the service ol Almighty God
in this past ol the kingdom: yea, as sonte say, in the whole kingdom.” hir.
Mula, ile Ls'glrthoase, p. ³⁴· while believing that the question can never be de·
finitely settled, is inclined to think that the traditional site is the right one. Dr.
Forbes, on the other hand, Livet ot SS. Ν. and K., pp abd-271, believes that
we “must conclude that the celebrated spot, where his body was visited by
pilgrims fos so many agas, the modern town ol Whithom, was the spot where
he erectsd Candida Casa ‘more Brittonibus inaotno.’” The nme opinion is
expressed also in the numm of Scottish Sar'nts, p. 422. The reasons assigned
lor this opinion are (ι) 'l'be ruins ol the Chapel ol the lale oi Whithern belong ιο
somewhere about the end oi the thirteentb century; (a) lt is not likely that ‘⁸ the
Praemonstsatensian monlss would build this sbabby little chapel as the record of the
spot where the great saint actually miniatered,” aud “impossible ιο suppose that
tbe earnest votaries oi the saint . . . would surround themselves wttb beaaty
at tbe place where they resided, while they spent so little care aud money on tbe
spot uvore actually associated with him ’¹ ς (3) There is no record ol a translation ol
the telios and no lestivd commemorative ol it. Against these it may be obsesvedy
(ι) Tbat tbe lact ol tbe existing ruins ui the Cbapel oi the lsle being oi the this·
teentb onttury tella nothing whatever agaim their site being that oi the cburcls
actually built by St. Ninian, no uvore than tbey would it they belonged ιο the
eighteentb or nineteaotb century. It iaqulte possible, and indeed probable that
tbe charcit built by tbe Salat was replaced by a new one in that great age ol ecclesi·
