xxxii. INTRODUCTION.

tv,

No ancient Latin Life of St Machar, Machor, or Mauritius,
ls now known to exist The best avallable sources os informa-
tion respecting the Saint are—1. The Lile in the Scottish
version ol the Legends ol the Saints already referred toas
containinga Lile oi St Ninian; 2. The lections in the Office
oi the Saint in the Aberdeen Breviary; and 3. The account
given oi him by O’Donnell in his Life oi St Columba-all oi
which seem to have been derived from a work now lost
References will also be found to him in the Regr'strum Epis- ’
capatus Aberdonensis, in the Martyrology os Aberdcen, in
Boethius, in Dempster, andin Camerarius. The sullest and
most important source is the poem attributed to Barbour.

According to the Aberdeen Breviary, “sanctum virum gignit
Hibernia, educavit illurn Albania, cujus corpus in reverentia
Turonensis tenet ecclesia’' He was the son of an lrish
chieitain, named Syaconus or Fiachna, and Synchena or Fin-
cboemia The date oi his birth is unknown. King places hirn
as late as the end oi the Ninth Century, but Dr. Reeves
identifies him with Tochannu Mocufircetea, one oi the twelve
companions os St Columba According to the Aberdeen
Breviary he was a contemporary and disciple ol St. Colman,
who named him in baptism Mocumma He was iostered by
“ane callit Telemane, the quhilk had riches at will.'' Already
as a child he is said to have exhibited signs oi great sanctity.
Angels were seen hovering around his cradle; the dead body oi
his younger brother when placed in bed with him, was warmed
by the touch os his flesh and restored to lile; and on two
occasions he was himself miraculously saved irom destruction.
When his sosterage was ended, his father, according to the Scot-
tish Legend, took him to St Columba, by whom he was educated.
