INTRODUCTION. xli.

MS. in this kingdom. lt is in a solio volume on vellum,oi the lat-
ter part of the Twelfth Century, and is preserved in the British
Museum, where it is marked Cotton Tiberius, D. ΙΙΙ. It is one oi
the MS. which suffered hythe fire. In 1868 the Life was issued
by the Surtees Society, and in 1884 an excellent translation oi
it was published hy William Forbes-lreith s.J.

Papehroch contended that the author of the Liie was
Theodorie, a monk of Durham, but it is now generally ascribed
to Turgot,¹ who entered into orders in 1074, became Prior oi
Durham in 1087, and was consecrated Arehbishop oi St
Andrews August 1, 1109, by Thomas Second Archbishop oi
York, with reservation ol the rights of his See in respect to the
question ol the primacy os York over Scotland· He was for
sometime the consessor os St Margaret, and died in the
monastery at Durham in 1115, whither he had obtained per·
mission from the king, to retire, owing to a disagreement with
him, probably, as Mr. Robertson suggests, in reference to the
necessity ol immediately remedelling the state of the Scottish
Church³

Dr. Forhes, who, however, remarks that its author is not ’
necessarily Turgot oi St Andrews, observes with truth of the
Life: “lt is lull ol instructive notices os the state os the
Scottish Church and Kingdom at the epoch ol the Norman
Conquest oi England, and it supplies us with the first really
authentic history os Scotland aiter the notices in Adamnan
and Baeda, the Pictish Chronicle and the Book oi Deer.'’
Equally J‘ust is his further remark: ‘¹ There isan atmosphere ol
calm, nnexcited truthsulness about the narrative, as well as an
absence ol the mythical, which commende it to us as the work
ol an eminent, truth-loving man, and the incidental allusions to
the current history hear the test os all we know os the times”⁴
