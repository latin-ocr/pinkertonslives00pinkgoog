tue that he most laclred3 that he was vindictive, passionate,
bold, a man ot' suile, born to be a soldier rather than a monk;
tull ot' contradictions and contradts ; tender and irritable, rude
and courteous, ironical and compassionate, caressing and im-
perious, grateful-md revenget'ul. ’ Dr. Reeues remarks that in
judging os the martial propensities o'i St Columba, “it will al·
ways be necessary to bear ln mind the complexion oi the times
in which he was born, 3ηά the peculiar condition ol society in
his day, which required even women to enter battle, and justi-
fied ecclesiastica in the occasional exercise ol warlare. More-
over, ii we may judge from the biographical records which
have descended to us, primitive lrish ecclesiastics, and es·
pecially the superior class, commonly known as Saints, were
very impatient oi contradiction, and very resentlul ol injury.
Excommunication, fasting against, and cursing, were in fre-
quent employment, and inanimate, as well as animate objecta
are represented as the subjects oi their maledictions St
Columba, who seems to have inherited the high bearing ol' his
race, was notdisposed to receive injuries, or even affronts, in
silence.” He was passionately lond oi fine manuscripts, and
would incur any amount of trouble or risk in order to procure
or copy them. For the national poetry ol his country and ior
the bards, he always manifested the greatest favour, and is him·
seli accounted one oi the poets oi lreland.

In the Second Preiace, Adamnan styles St Columba
“monasteriorum pater et fundator.'’ The Old lrish Lile states
that his churches numbered three hundred, and in lists,
which are admittedly incomplete, there are enumerated
thirty-seven dedications to him in lreland, thirty-three among
the Albanlc Scots, and twenty-five among the Picts ol Scot-
land-making in all, in Scotland and lreland, ninety-five.¹
There were probably many othere, oi which nothing is now
known.
