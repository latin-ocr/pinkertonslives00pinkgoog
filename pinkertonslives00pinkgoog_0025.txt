The number of miracles which are said to have been wrought
at St. Ninian’s tomb‚ or through his intervention, is very great

Sc Ailred simply says3 “At his most sacred tomb the sick
were cured‚ the lepers cleansed, the wicked terrified, the blind
receive their sight ;'’ but the author of the Scottish Ver·
sion ol the Saint’s Life, when accounting sor the great annual
concourse of pilgrims at Candida Casa, gives the following
much more detailed account :-
