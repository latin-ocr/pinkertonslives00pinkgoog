whose lives are given. The only exception to this isin the

case ol St. Margaret. Her Office is taken t'or the most part
srom that sor Holy Women, and the Readings peculiar to it
have not been considered os sufficient importance to be repro·
duced here. The principal Readings in the Office sor the
Festival os her Translation will be found in Papebroch's second
Appendix to her Life

Additions also are the Introduction and the majority ol the
Notes. ln the first some account is given, where possible, os
the Authors os the Lives, the sources whence they derived
their information, and ot' their other writings, and in the case
ot' several ot' the Saints the leading events in their lives are
narrated. The Notes have been gathered t'rom many sources,
and refer in the majority of instances to persons and places.
It is hardly necessary to remark that neither the Introduction
nor the Notes profess to be exhaustive.

Pinkerton's Presace and a lew ol his Notos, which will be
readily distinguished, have been retained. The rest ot' the
original Notes and an Appendix containing a list os the
Editors of the different volumes os the Acta Sanctomm, have
been omitted.

The alterations made on the Original Edition‚ as all who are
acquainted with it will readily believe, have involved a very
great amount ol labour, which the Editor has been compelled
to carry on amid the distractions ot' abusy lis . lt is hoped,
however, that they are such as to entitle the present Edition to
be regarded as a decided improvement upon its predecessor.

The thanks os the Editor are due to Mr. George Parker,
Oxt'ord, sor collating the textos the Life ol St Ninian, and to
Mr. W. Etienne Phelps‚ Dublin, lor performing the same office
sor that os the Lives ol St Kentigern and St Serl; but
especially to Dr. Reeves, sor the generous permission to use his
readings of the codices Regius and Cottonianus ot' Adamnan,
and sor allowing him to make use ol the information contained
in his remarkably erudite and, indeed, magnificent edition of
Adamnan's Life os St Columba

March, 1889.
