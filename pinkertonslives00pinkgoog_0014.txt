PREFACE.

meERTON's intention in connection with this work, which
has long been out oi print and exceedingiy scarce, seems to
have been to issue in a handy form the ancient Lives of the
most celebrated oi the Scottish Saints The intention was
good, and deserves to be extended to the Lives oi the less
known among those who were once honoured in the national
Church

Some os the Lives Pinkerton selected have since been
printed from better texts and edited with greater skill;
butas no attempt has been made to reproduce the whole
collection, some oi thern, as, ior instance, Cummian’s Life oi
St Columba, Turgot’s Life of St Margaret, with the Introduc·
tion, Notes, and Appendices of Papebroch, and the Life of St
Magnus, are still accessible only in rare or expensive works.

1n the present edition, the texts have been collated and
many corrections made; the deficiencies at the beginning oi
the Life oi St Ninian and os Adamnan’s Lise os St Columba
have been supplied; and sor Pinkerton's textos the Life oi
St Kentigern, that of the MS. in Archbishop Marsh‘s Library,
Dublin, which is in every respect better, has been substituted.

The additions to the original contents oi the work are:-
The Office oi St Machor, based upon an old Latin Life which
is now lost; the fragment os a Life oi St Kentigern, first
printed by Professor Cosmo Innes in his Registmm Episco-
patus Glasguensis‚ and subsequently, by Dr. A P. Forbes;
the Life of St. Seri, srorn the same MS. as the Life os
St Kentigern, first published by Dr. Sirene in his
Chroniclcs os tie {Picis and Scots,· the Legend respecting
the bringing os the Relics os st Andrew to Scotland,
from the Aberdeen Breviary; and the Offices ior the Saints
