xii INTRODUCTION.

Ailred’s time, and of what he imagined it was in St Ninian's,
together with a number of legends he found written down or
floating about in the popular mind.

Ailred’s Life os St N inian was first printed by Pinkerton in
the Original Edition oi the present work, from a beautiful MS.
in the Bodleian Library, Oxsord. lt was again, and more
correctly, printed by Bishop Forbes in 1874, who also collated
the MS. in the British Museum. For the present edition, the
Bodleian MS. has been again read, and a very lew addi-
tional corrections made. The corrections made on Pinkerton‘s
text are numerous, and the Prologue, which for some unac-
countable reason he omitted, has been supplied

In a volume of the Lives ol the Saints in the Burgundian
Library at Brussels, there is another lise of St. Ninian in an
abridged form. This is said to have been in all probability the
one used by Capgrave when compiling his Life of the Saint sor
his Nova Legenda. The old Irish Life, from which Ussher gives
an extract, andos which the Bollandists say they had a transla-
tion made sor them by Father Fitzsimon‚ cannot now be found.
The same has to be said ol two MSS. of the Life os St N inian,
which, according to the Bollandists, formerly existed, one
belonging to the Carthusian Convent at Cologne, and the other
to the Monasterium Rubeae Vallis. The nine readings in the
Office of the Saint in the Aberdeen Breviary are evidently
taken from St. Ailred’s Life.⁵

One ol the most interesting sources os information respecting
St. Ninian is an anonymous MS. belonging to the University
Library, Cambridge, and written in the Scottish dialect of the
Fourteenth Century. This MS. contains a series ol fifty
Legends or Lives os the Saints, among which is the Life or
Legend of St Ninian. The work was discovered by Mr.
Henry Bradshaw‚ and in 1866 was ascribed by him to John
Barbour, Archdeacon os Aberdeen and author os T lte Bruce.
At the present moment its authorship is under discussion, but
whoever its author was the interest attaching to it is great⁶
