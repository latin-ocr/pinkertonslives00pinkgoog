St Ninian lived in one of the chief epochs in the history os
the Christian Church In the East‚ the Gregories, St Basil,
and St. chrysostom, were toiling and suffering sor the saith,
and in the West the destinies oi the Church were being
moulded by no less Saints than Jerome, Ambrose‚ and
Augustine. In Britain all was anarchy and barbarous warsare.
The Roman legions were being withdrawn, and Britons,

Saxons, Picts, and Scots, were each fighting for their own hand.
In these troublous times St. Ninian appeared, and attempted
in another way, and under the inspiration oi a different spirit,
what the Roman legionaries had sailed to effect To use the
words os the old Scottish legend, “thru his lif and his
techinge,” he

‘⁴ Ennmpil gei oi gad loninge
Til el that myeht hym ee or here,
Or quhare he can duel come nere ς
For ns ι Ιινῐιῑεω he wes lycht‚
nm in myrknes giffis men syeht,
Hou thei mid ieie amur ay,
And to uertu chet the ray,
And in this mirknes gang sa enine

And til men os el estate
