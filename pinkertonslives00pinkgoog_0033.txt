the habit ol paying annually to the chief ol the existing dynasty;
and on the other, to bring about the general adoption ol the
new Easter observance His stay does not appear to have
been long. Five years later, in 697, he returned to lreland,
and was present at a great synod oi ecclesiastics and chieitains
at Birr, where, according to the Annals ol Ulster, “dedit legem
innocentium populis.'' This law was aimed at a great social
reformation, and having obtained the highest sanction oi the
people, became known as the law ol Adamnan. One great
reiorm it is said to have eflected was the exemption oi women
from going to battle As told by the Book oi lecan, the
origin ol this salutary reform was as follows: “Adamnan
happened to be travelling one day through the plain oi Bregia
with his mother on his back, when they saw two armies en-
gaged in mutual conflict It happened then that Ronait, the
mother ol Adamnan, observed a woman, with an iron reaping·
hook in her hand, dragging another woman out ot' the opposite
battalion with the hook iastened in one ol her breasts For
men and women went equally to battle at that time Alter
this Ronait sat down, and said, ‘ Thou shalt not take me from
this spot until thou exemptest women ior ever l'rom being in
this condition, and from excursione and hostings.’ Adamnan
then promised that thing. There happened afterwards a con-
vention in Ireland, and Adamnan, with the principal partos
the clergy ol Ireland, went to that assembly, and hc exempted
the women at it''⁵

The interval between 697 and the year ol his death seems to
have been spent by Adamnan in lreland. ln the year 701
he is said to have convened a synod at Tara, and there obtained

the condemnation oi lrgalach, son oi Conang, great-grandson
oi Aedh Slaine‚ and lord ol Cianachta in Meath, who was guilty
os the murder oi his own cousin N iall, son ol Cearnach Sotal.
Adamnan died in the year 704, aged seventy·seven, on the 2 3rd
ol September, on which day he is celebrated in the lrish and
Scottish calendars.

ln the esteem ol his contemporaries Adamnan stood high,
