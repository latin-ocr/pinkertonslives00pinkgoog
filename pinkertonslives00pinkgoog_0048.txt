of canardos Egypt, and ·“is the venerable old man who
possesses Cuilenross, in Stratherne, in the Comgells, between
the Ochil Hills and the sea of Giudan''¹ According to the
Life here printed his father was Obeth, a King in the land of
canaan, and his mother Alpia, an Arabian princess. After
studying thirteen years iu Alexandria he became successively
Bishop of Canaan, Patriarch of Jerusalem, an honoured guest
et Constantinople, and Pope at Rome He then, under the
guldence of an angel, crossed the Alps and cameto Scotland‚
where he met with Adamnan, the biographer of Columba and
Abbot of Hy, from whom he received Fife and “from the

Fife, preaching and founding churches everywhere ln neither

that ‘¹ Brude son of Dergard‚ gives the isle of Lochleven to the
Omnipotent God and to St Servanus, and to the Keledei
hermits dwelling there'’ Dr. Sirene identifies this Brude with
Brude theson of Derile‚ who reigned from 697 to 706, and thus
brings Erude, Adamnan and Servanus together, about· the close
os the Seventb Century, or nearly two centuries later than the
time of St Kentigern.²
